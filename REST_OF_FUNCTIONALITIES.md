This is all the functionalities that we intended to cover during the presentation but we couldn't.

Okay, where is the select winner part?
Actually, we were unable to put this feature into the app because of the time. But, it will be the first feature that we will add in the future insha allah.

## Note
We are using a scheduled function with the help of [firebase cloud functions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions) that run to start and end the hackathon based on the dates that the manager has selected during hackathon creation.

In this example We change the dates to the current recording time directly from the database and make the scheduled function handle changing the status of the hackathon to have a real example.

So, in case you want to try to create or participate in hackathon. That hackathon will start and end based on the dates given automatically.

See [Schedule functions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/schedule-functions)
